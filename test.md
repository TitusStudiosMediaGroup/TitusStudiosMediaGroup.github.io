I do a lot of things, Jack of all Trades if you will. Notably: Programming (Expression2, Lua, C#, etc), is a large part of my life. Video Editing and Photography is another one of my talents, same goes for, Tinkering with Electronics & Microprocessors (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc), Engineering, and have lots of interest in technology, computing, and improving the world. I’m very hands on and don't mind getting dirty in the process.
