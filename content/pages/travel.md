# Living In New Zealand

Living in New Zealand is a blast, no matter where you go in our country there are always beautiful scenery. I have always lived in New Zealand and *as of April 2019* I have not traveled outside of New Zealand. I plan to some day but flights are expensive and me and my family are quite busy.

I have seen most of the Manawatu District by rail, usually from FSR Rail tours of the Manawatu Gorge and similar trips.

However I have seen most of the North Island by car - as my main source traspation - One of my goals for my life is to explore the whole of New Zealand, I have yet to goto the South Island, but I do plan to sometime near the end of 2019. I have *as of April 2019* explored aprox 40-50% of the North Island, should increase a far bit by the end of this year, as I have a few major trips planned.

# Living in the "Big City"

I have never lived in Auckland but its New Zealands Capital *(I live in Hawkes Bay, 415Km from Auckland, Lol)*, I have been there multiple times but only for one week each time.

I would like to live there but close to the CBD *(Central Business District)* area but I don't have $2 mil for one month of rent near Queen St. Its kinda like New York but minus all the birds. Everything is close to you - Everything is less then 5 mins away - And everything is open quite late, as in shops are usually open 24 hours. **Ex, You could go out at 4 AM and get food, and do the same at 3 PM.**

# Sky Tower, Auckland

If you ever come to New Zealand and your around the Auckland Area, I would go check out the Sky Tower *And if you have some cash handy, it was $30 NZD when I was last there (quite a bit)* But the views from up there are quite amazing, and you can get some pretty nice photos from up there *(700'ish Meters)*. Here are some photos from when I was last at the Sky Tower Below.
