# What is **Titus Studios Media?**
**Titus Studios Media** *(Also known as Titus Studios Media Group)* is a Media Production Business that I run locally out of my home. We edit and produce content for YouTube and other such online services. Titus Studios was established on the **25th of July 2013**, since then we have made/edited numerous series, documentaries, short films, and have been editing for a number of YouTubers.

We continue to keep our high standards and produce high quality content for the public to view.

Titus Studios Media is always looking to improve the community and produce better content.

As far as we know, The original creation of Titus Studios was to be a "Tech Blog", then later in 2016 branched out to Video Editing and later video production. It is unclear where we will be heading, or when we will stop, but at out current point we strive to keep, Building, Editing, and Releasing content for the public. We are always on the look for your project.
