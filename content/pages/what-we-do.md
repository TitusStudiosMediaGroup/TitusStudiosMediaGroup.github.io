# Experssion 2

What I am most commonly known for, is developing code in Expression 2. If you would like to see some of my work check out my GitHub: [https://github.com/titus-studios-media](https://github.com/titus-studios-media)

By far, Expression 2 is my best known language. Expression 2 is a lua based language with syntax similar to CSS. The syntax in the Expression 2 will take some time to get used to, but will give you a lot of power over your expressions. In Expression 2 conditionals, numbers are considered false if they equal 0. Otherwise, they are considered true. Functions and methods which conceptually return "true" or "false" return 1 and 0 respectively. 

Remember there is not just one way to code something, there are several ways you can accomplish the same task in Expression 2, some are better than others... Figuring out which one is the best (for a task) can be difficult, depending if you want it to be optimized or if you want it to have less calculations running per-tick (usually 33 per second), most of this comes with long time experience.
