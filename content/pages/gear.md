## Cameras

**Canon EOS 800D** Our main videography and photography DSLR. Good general purpose DSLR, has good low light, and when paired with some good glass, you can get some amazing footage and/or photos out of it. Does 60FPS at 1080p, which is plenty for what we make.

**Canon EOS 1200D** Secondary DSLR, was our previous main shooter. Now is used for photography or a second angle of video now and then.

**GoPro Hero 3+ Black** Our GoPro. Great for wide angle video (where it is needed), POV shots, etc. We usually use it in vehicles, for time lapses or as an interior camera, as its low profile body and small size makes it ideal.

## Lenses

**Canon EF-S 18-55mm Lens** Main shooter lens. Is not the best lens by all means, but it gets the job done.

**Tamron 70-210mm Lens** Main Zoom Lens. Is quite heavy, and you **MUST** hold it from the lens, not the body, or the lens mount on our Canons will snap right off. Great for long distance zoom shots.

**Canon EF 24-70mm Lens** The little brother of the Tamron 70-210mm Lens. Good for general zoom shots, nothing much else to it.

**Canon EF 50mm Lens** Our most unused lens out of them all, our 50mm. Great for portraits, of which we do little to none of. Might be handy some day.

## Audio

**Rode Videomic Pro** Our main DSLR microphone. Has great audio quality straight out of the box. Great for almost all of our videos. We do use a wireless lavalier mic for far distance or "presenter" shots.

## Post Audio Mixing

**Phonic MR2643XD 18-Channel Helix-Board Powered XLR & Line Mixer**

We edit most of our recorded audio during post production. We start by feeding in the audio with my **Phonic MR2643XD 18-Channel Helix-Board Powered XLR & Line Mixer**, add some EQ or digital effects and then input it into one of our editing rigs. In those editing rigs we use **Voicemeeter** to input our line audio and allow Windows to use it, we also may apply any last tweeks at this stage. 

Then we will use Adobe Audition to record the audio. Once we have our audio at software level we will fix any noticeable bugs and improve quality if needed. Any minor bugs can be fixed during editing.

*Note: Some gear is not on this page due to missing product photos, or we ran out of room.*
