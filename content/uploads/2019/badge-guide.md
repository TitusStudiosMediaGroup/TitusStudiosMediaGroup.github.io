# How to make a Fursona Badge

## What is a Badge?
Con or Fursona Badges are "personalized identification badges" typically 3" x 4" in size. These badges can be used to identify a fur.
They are mostly referred to as "Con Badges" as they are typically worn during or at conventions, furmeets, etc.

There are two main kinds of badges; Membership or Official Badges, which are issued by convention hosts... and Artist Badges or Fursona Badges, which are a specialized form of commission. Most common term: "Con Badges" refers to both.

## Kinds of Badges
* Badges trimmed to the character's / name's outline
* Oversized badges (designed to be worn with a costume or otherwise)
* Sculpted badges
* 'Hanging' badges where the art (or portions of it) is dangling from an otherwise fixed segment of the badge
* Customized jewelry charms, either as part of a larger badge or to be worn on other prominent accessories such as a collar
* Conbadges made for couples that fit together

## Making your own Badge
Making a Badge in my experience has been fairly straight forward.

**First:** You need some art! You can either, commision some art for your badge, create new artwork, or use existing artwork. For whatever one you choose the steps below will still apply.

_add note about using existing artwork HERE_

To begin making your badge you will need some supplies:
* A Computer
* Photo Editing Software
* A Printer
* Transparent / Clear Adhesive Bookcovering OR a Laminator
* Scissors
* Neck Badge Holder **(Optional)**


## Step One: Editing the Artwork
For making my Badge I will use Adobe Photoshop, as I have a fair bit of experience on it.
Firstly, I will open a piece of artwork that I think would go well on a badge (Headshots are usually the best)

Now that I have my artwork, I will remove all the unnecessary aspects, such as: Background, Text, Etc (Optional)
This is so that when I print it, I will use less ink, and so it is easier to edit.

Make a new document the size of the Paper you are using, In my case A4 (210 × 297 millimeters or 8.27 × 11.69 inches)
This is because we will be printing it out, duh. And so that we can get a "view for scale", also meaning we don't have to print out heaps of tests to get the size we want.

## Step Two: Adding Text
I have copied my fursonas artwork onto the paper document, and added a text layer for adding the characters name (and or, species)
I will later change it to my fursonas name, for now it will stay as "Lorem ipsum"

I have replaced the text layer with my fursonas name **"Reon"** and have added a cool species designation that I designed while making my Reference Sheet. I have yet to scale it to my liking...

Finding a suitable position for the text can be a tricky task, I suggest you mess around with multiple designs till you find a location you like the best. In my case I envisioned it being below the visor of the Protogen.

I have done some color rendering on the text, and added a solid to the center of the "O" with some Blending Effects: Outer Glow and a Color Overlay for quick and simple color changing. At this point, you should be able to see your badge coming together!

Time for Scaling and centering!
I will be selling my badge to a suitable size for printing and for what size I would like it to come out as.
Once you have scaled the design to your liking, It is a good measure to centre it, but feel free to move it to your own location.

Now take a step back and evaluate your work so far, check for errors, defects, glitches, etc with your work so far. If you are happy with it so far, we can continue on to printing!

## Step Three: Printing
Now that you are happy with your work, and feel it is ready to print, go for it!
Use 'Ctrl+P' to open the print menu, this is for most programs too.

Select your printer in the menu, for me it's my Laser Printer.
Set the other settings to your liking! I do suggest that you have it centred, but not scaled.

Click the 'Print' Button and this menu should pop up, if you haven't already setup a default printer in Photoshop, Select the printer that you selected before, then click the 'Print' Button on that window.

This message may pop up if you don't have it auto scaled, ignore this and click 'Proceed'
