# Types of Fursuits - Pros and Cons

There are many different kinds of Fursuits out there, dependant on the owner's character design, mechanical or even electrical components, etc. Fursuits are a real work of art! Fursuits can range from a simple Tail and Ears, to a full fursuit (Similar to mascot suits).
Fursuits allows the wearer to "be" their Fursona (Furry Persona), express feelings, and generally just be a big fluffy animal. Fursuits can come in the price range of between, $100 up to thousands of dollars on a single suit. Some fursuits may include mechanical or even electrical components tailored to the character.

### Types of Fursuits
 * Head
 * Mini-partial
 * Full-partial
 * Half Suit
 * Full Plantigrade Suit
 * Full Digitigrade Suit
 * Dropped Crotch Suit
 * Quad Suit
 
All of these types have their Pros and Cons. Heads for example, are pretty self explanatory, "Just a head". No Tail, Legs, Bodysuit, etc.
The Pros of this are; You have good ventilation, meaning they are much cooler than a fullsuit. Lightweight, small and compact and most importantly, they are one of the easiest to travel with, not if the best.

On the other hand, A full Digitigrade suit with padding is practically a walking sauna. The Cons with owning a fullsuit will differ from one suit to the next, but here are some of the most common ones; **HEAT!!** You will get hot in these suits, much more than with a head suit. They are also fairly large and can be quite hard to travel with in some situations; With all that padding (if the suit has padding) and the space that the fullbody suit can take up while traveling.

# Partial Suits

### Head Suit
Head suits are pretty self explanatory, they are just a head. No tail, No bodysuit, etc. They are usually made quickly, and are much cheaper than fullsuits. About as simple as it gets.

### Mini Partial
Mini Partials include: A Head, Tail, and Hand paws. This means you don't have a bodysuit, feet paws, etc. These suits are very easy to transport, most can fit into a sports bag, workout bag, etc. They are a little more expensive but are still quite cheap for what you can get. These are possibly the best option if you are only just starting out as a fursuiter, just to get used to the "feel". As they don't have a bodysuit, you will have to wear a shirt with it at all times, and they are also restricted to human shape.

### Full Partial
These are pretty much the same as Mini Partials, however they *usually (as this can differ from maker to maker)* include: A Head, Tail, Hand paws, Feet Paws, Leg Sleeves and Arm Sleeves. This can give off the illusion of a fullsuit with the ability to wear short sleeved shirts, but without having a bodysuit underneath. Temperature in these types of suits are usually pretty good, when paired with a moderately ventilated head.

### Half Suit
Pretty much a fullsuit, but only half! This means you can have either, the suit covering the upper half of your body, or the lower half. These are great for having Digitigrade legs, but without the hassle of an entire suit.

# Full Suits

### Full Plantigrade Suit
Simply put it, just normal human leg structure. These suits are very easy to come in and out of, as there is no padding in the legs. They are also cheaper than Digitigrade legs, due to the fact there is no padding. They are comfy to wear and are relatively easy to transport, fullsuits do take up much more room than partials, but with non-padded suits you can cheat by rolling them up, however this is not recommended as it may cause the fur to crease, leaving crease lines. Fullsuits get **VERY HOT**, you absolutely need to disinfect your fullsuit after every use, as you are going to sweat big time while in one of these suits.

### Full Digitigrade Suit
In simple terms, the leg structure is more animal like, in more of a zig-zag pattern than straight up and down. These suits can look extremely good, but the downside to having the zig-zag like structure is that it is made with padding. The suit overall will cost a lot more with the Digigrade legs, and the padding can restrict your movement. The padding basically acts as an insulator, keeping heat inside and making it the opposite of a conductor, which will let heat pass into or even through it, in plain terms, it's gonna get hot, Really hot.

Another downside to having Digitigrade Legs is that they are much bigger, taking up two to three times the space of Plantigrade legs. This will mean you may get restrictions when traveling via... Air, Car, Etc. In order to maximize the space you have, you will have to get creative on how you pack your fursuit when you travel. This can apply to any suit, even partials in some cases.

### Dropped Crotch Suit
It is exactly what it sounds like, the crotch is dropped to around your thighs or your knees. This can give the illusion of a longer body or shorter legs. Has around the same Pros and Cons for Digitigrade suits, but heaps more expensive! Dropped croches take a very long time to master, and are hard to pull off, which sadly means it will cost more. On top of that, they are extremely restricting when it comes to movement, you will have to practically woddle in these suits, which looks adorable but you have no chance of running.

### Quad Suit
When these suits are done right, they turn out fabulous. People will be looking at you and you will be getting photos taken every few seconds. However they have more Cons than Pros, They are Extremely Expensive, They are Hard to Walk in (Extremely restrive in the movements you can make), Poor Vision (You will be looking at the ground most of the time in-suit), and you will **NEED** and Handler 24/7 while in-suit, as you are, quite literally, Blind.

_Note: If you are mix and matching partial suits, Ie, you make your own bodysuit, the fabric companies dye the fur in big batches, meaning you will practically never be able to find the exact same color fur, even with whites and blacks._
