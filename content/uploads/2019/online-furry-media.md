# Online Furry Media - Videos

There are heaps of different forms of online media, focusing on furry based media, and furthermore, Videos. 
As of June 2019, YouTube is the number one most used and popular video sharing platform, with most of the furry related video based content being posted on there. I personally (and some others can agree) think YouTube is one of the best platforms to learn about furries, The ups, (and yes) downs. There is a wide variety of content to view, to match your personal interest and or involvement in the fandom, let alone being educated along the way. 


# What you can Find, and Kinds Content

On YouTube, there are 'Furry' based channels with centralised topics going from; Education to Comedy, with many topics in between.
Also on YouTube, you can get a 'Third-person' perspective on yourself, others or even the fandom.

Some of the topics discussed around the furry fandom on YouTube are:
 * Educational - Explaining aspects of the Fandom, Ie; Slang, Safety, the Do's and Don'ts, The list goes on.
 * Informational - Discussing certain furry events in your local area, what's coming up or has been.
 * Comedy
 * Art Tutorials
 * Fursuit Making / Tutorials
 * The list goes on...


# Creativity

One of the best parts of YouTube by far, and the lifeblood of this fandom, is the creativity. Seeing the enthusiasm, time, research, and effort people put into a single videos can blow away even myself. As a content creator myself, as a video editor for SparkyBites and my own personal channel it can take an enormous amount of effort to make videos on a regular basis, add on doing research, fact checking, editing, etc. There is so much more you can express in a video compared to text, the limit to what you can create is the sky.

From people like Majira Strawberry who makes "Vlog" styled content, to people like Pocari Roo and BetaEtaDelota who make educational videos on the furry fandom. You can learn a massive amount from these channels, and I would definitely recommend you check these awesome people if you haven't seen their content.
