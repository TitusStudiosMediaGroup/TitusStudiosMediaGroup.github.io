# How to get involved in the Furry Fandom


# Social Media

The Furry Fandom is mostly based online, having online social media is one of the best ways to gain friendships and make connections. If you are new to the fandom, I can recommend some social media platforms to get you started. If you are however personally uncomfortable displaying it on your main online account, but you want to be on one of these platforms, you can make a separate account from your personal account, this is what you will find in most cases.

### Social Media Platforms
 * Twitter
 * Facebook

### Dedicated Furry Platforms
 * Furaffinity
 * Furry Amino
 
Twitter is one of the most used social media platforms for furries. Mostly notable for artists, fursuit makers, conventions, etc.
 
Facebook is one of the more "local based" social media platforms. You can find local furmeets, furry conventions (times and dates), local furries in your area, artists, fursuits, etc... The list goes on. Facebook is usually good for most aspects of the furry fandom and you can definitely meet some great people on it.

# Going to Local Furmeets

One of the best ways by far that I have found to get more involved in this community, is to attend local Furmeets / gatherings.
A furmeet is a relatively small real-life gathering of furries. Furmeets may be periodically scheduled or regular events. A furmeet may range in size, from a small group to dozens. When a furmeet attracts more than approximately 100 attendees, and starts to add features such as organized programming and the sale of goods, it begins to be considered a convention.

At furmeets, attendees will often have dinner, watch movies (both furry and non-furry related), play roleplaying games or video games, or draw. Sometimes a furmeet is as casual as simply getting together to talk and have a few drinks at a local cafe, bar, pub or restaurant. Furmeets can be a fun way to meet other furs and make new friends, get to know local furs, and generally have fun.

**Be sure:** To check the age requirement if you are under 21 years of age, most Furmeets do have an age requirement.

Some of these (Charity Calendar) are supporting "One of the largest foal rescue facilities in the US, Last Chance Corral (LCC) has been rescuing mistreated, unwanted, and misunderstood horses and foals for over 30 years.  Their work is absolutely critical for the 150+ foals that come into their care every year. As Victoria, the founder of LCC, [puts it herself](https://mashable.com/2015/06/14/last-chance-corral/), “We wanted to put our efforts into something that people don’t want to work with, which is newborns. We needed to at least give them a chance.” - Artworktee
