# What is a Furry?

The Furry Community initially grew out of the Science Fiction and Fantasy fandoms.

In very broad terms, Furries are fans of anthropomorphism and things having to do with creatures and animals.
This is known as "anthropomorphic animals", It is used to describe a concept called anthropomorphism, or ascribing human characteristics to non-human beings. Typically, this is used in reference to deities, which are usually given the form of humans. However, the word can apply to non-human things, including animals and plants.
In a literary sense, there is a difference between ascribing human traits to an object (anthropomorphism), or to an abstract concept (personification).

There are a vast array of subject areas that Furries are interested in:

 * Mythology (eg. totem spirits and animism);
 * Science (eg. bioengineering and veterinary sciences);
 * Literature (eg. Poetry and storytelling);
 * Fine arts (eg. Drawing, painting, sculpture and costume making);
 * Performing arts (eg. Singing, music and fursuit performance);
 * Mass Media (eg. Films, cartoons and television shows);
 * and the list goes on…

Furries themselves have a wide variety of ages, races and cultures, and have a diverse range of backgrounds, from students to highly qualified industry professionals (Doctors, lawyers, academics and even rocket scientists).

Just as there is a huge range of people who make up the Furry Community, the way they choose to identify with the fandom is equally varied. Some are simply happy sit with friends and watch Furry cartoons and anime. Some will produce anthropomorphic art of their favourite characters. Others will make and wear fursuits of their of their Furry persona.


# Furry Fandom

The furry fandom is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animal characters with human personalities and characteristics.
Examples of anthropomorphic attributes include exhibiting human intelligence and facial expressions, speaking, walking on two legs, and wearing clothes. The term "furry fandom" is also used to refer to the community of people who gather on the Internet and at furry conventions


# Conventions

Sufficient interest and membership has enabled the creation of many furry conventions in North America and Europe. A furry convention is for the fans get together to buy and sell artwork, participate in workshops, wear costumes, and socialize. The world's largest furry convention, [Anthrocon](https://www.anthrocon.org/) with more than 5,861 participants, held annually in Pittsburgh in June, was estimated to have generated approximately $3 million to Pittsburgh's economy in 2008. Another convention, [Further Confusion](https://www.furtherconfusion.org/), held in San Jose each January, closely follows Anthrocon in scale and attendance. US$470,000 was raised in conventions for charity from 2000–9. The first known furry convention, ConFurence, is no longer held; Califur has replaced it, as both conventions were based in Southern California. A University of California, Davis survey suggested that about 40% of furries had attended at least one furry convention.

# Websites and Online Communities

The Internet contains a multitude of furry websites and online communities, such as art community websites Fur Affinity, Inkbunny, SoFurry and Weasyl; social networking sites Furry 4 Life, FurNation; and WikiFur, a collaborative furry wiki. These, with the IRC networks FurNet and Anthrochat, form a key part of furry fandom. 
There are several webcomics featuring animal characters created by or for furry fans; as such, they may be referred to as furry comics. One such comic, T.H.E. Fox, was first published on CompuServe in 1986, predating the World Wide Web by several years, while another, Kevin and Kell by Bill Holbrook, has been awarded both a Web Cartoonists' Choice Award and an Ursa Major Award.

# Fursuit - Fursuits

Fursuits, originally known as zoots, are animal based costumes associated with the furry fandom. The term, coined in 1993 by Robert King, can also refer to animal mascot costumes in general, as opposed to human or anthropomorphized object mascots.
Owners are known as fursuiters, furzooters, or suiter/zooters, while the act of wearing a fursuit is usually referred to as fursuiting (originally as zooting, named after the Chicano zoot suiters of the Los Angeles area of the 1940s).

### Types of Fursuits

Fursuits range from simple tails and ears to full costumes with mechanical/electronic components. Similar to mascot suits, they allow the wearer to adopt another animal look and/or personality while in costume. Owners can spend less than one-hundred to many thousands of dollars on one fursuit, depending on the complexity of the design and on the materials used. These items are mainly sold online, with many makers owning sites dedicated to their suits. Suiting paraphernalia is often sold at "Furry Conventions." Furries may make their own using online tutorials and/or advice, or have hobbyist or professional fursuit maker or company assist them.

There are many types of fursuits. There are partials and fullsuits (along with several categories stemming from them. Suits that cover the whole body, or fullsuits, come with a head, a bodysuit, feetpaws, forepaws (hands), and a tail. There are three main types of fullsuits; the plantigrade, the digitgrade, and the unguligrade. Plantigrade gives a suit a more anthropomorphic look, adding no animalistic qualities to the legs. Digitgrade is used for canines, felines, birds, dinosaurs, and various other creatures. Unguligrade is used for hoofed animals such as horses or deer. A partial suit or half-suit contains the above, only without the body. This allows the wearer to don ordinary clothing (or a different costume) overtop of the paws, head and tail. In partial suits, the tail is usually attached to a belt, and the arms and legs have sleeves that can go up as far as the shoulders and pelvis, respectively. A third type known as the three-quarter suit has been developed, which consists of a head, arms and pants made to look like the legs, tail and feet of the animal in question, which works well for characters who only wear shirts. There is also an uncommon suit type; the quadsuit. It uses the arms of its wearer as the animals forelegs, and the hind legs are often stilts.

### Body language

Fursuiters typically do not speak in costume. This may be for a variety of reasons:

 * To preserve the anonymity or conceal the gender of the performer
 * The design of most suits muffles the voice of the performer
 * Most animals don't talk
 * It might cause an unwanted break of character
 * Because they just don't want to
 * Because of this, acting in suit is mostly about body language. A fursuiter may wiggle around excitedly, shiver in fear, stomp around    in anger, or hand their head in sadness.

When a fursuiter does speak in costume, it is often just to their handler and/or close friends. Alternately, fursuiters may only speak in some limited fashion, either with a limited vocabulary, or simply using as few words as necessary.

Increasingly, more elaborate fursuits are being built with some form of talk-jaw, either physically (the fursuit's lower jaw being attached to the fursuiter's chin or pressed physically against by the fursuiter's lower jaw in some other holding fashion) or by the use of mechanical/electronic devices, which enables the fursuiter to "talk".
