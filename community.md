# My Goal

One of my main goals and passions for Train Build *(and my most notable)* is trying to bring the community together. I have started *as of 2019* making some public together Expression 2(s) for the community, rather than keeping them to myself, expanding my workload and creating a diverse range of well made public E2s to be used on locomotives.

# Expanding The Community

Another one of my main goals is to help build and expand the community, bringing friends and colleagues and welcoming them to the world of Train Build, helping them get the basics down and getting them a locomotive built with reasonable quality.

# Contributing To Servers

And to finish it all off, Me contributing my time and effort to server staff, managing players who break the rules and break drama that can break friendships and eventually communities. I devote most of my time into Train Build and most of the time in Train Build is used for me being staff on a few servers, staying up late - doing the night shift. *(My time zone mesh very well with US Severs and US Staff, when people in the US goto bed, its only noon for me, when I goto bed they are up.)* Just consider that if your thinking of adding me.
