### What I Do

# What do I do?

I do lots of things… Like, **a lot** of things.

Here are a few:

I have always had an interest in computers, I first used a computer when I was three years old, always poking around the web, looking up about things I was interested about, and leading to me finding the website, YouTube. I was instantly attached. Since then, I have gained so much knowledge and found so many hobbies that I never thought of. 

Programming is a big part of my life nowadays, around early 2010 I began playing on the platform Roblox, and started making my own maps in the Studio application. In the Studio application you can code scripts to do things inside of the engine, for instance, change the color of a “Brick”, depending on Value A’s output. 

All the scripts were in Lua, which is were I get most of my general programming knowledge from. Since learning **Lua**, I have learnt a lot of other languages, such as: **C#**, **C++**, **C**, **Shell**, **Expression 2**, **Python**, etc. I spend a lot of my free time playing Garry’s Mod, which is a modified version of HalfLife 2 on Steam. 

In Garry’s Mod you can download addons such as Wiremod. With Wiremod you can wire a button to a light, use gates to make logic circuits, and even build your own computer! But what I am most interested in is Expression 2, Wiremods programming language.

I have also been passionate about Tinkering and Electrical Engineering, as in, getting a product, finding other uses, or upgrades for that product, and making those changes. This usually involves me doing Woodwork, Metal work and for the most part, Electrical Engineering. I have always had an attachment to electronics, and tinkering, put the two together, and I started making my own electrical circuits.


I'm a very hands on person and dont mind getting my hands dirty to get something done right.
