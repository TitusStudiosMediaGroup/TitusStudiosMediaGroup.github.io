# What is **Titus Studios Media?**

Titus Studios Media (Also known as Titus Studios Media Group), is a Media Production business in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, established on the 25th of July, 2013.

Titus Studios Media was originally a collective among friends, producing a technology blog on the YouTube platform, in the form of videos. In 2015, the group decided to make Titus Studios Media a profitable business, moved away from blogging about technology, and went on to media production. In May 2016, all members from the company dropped and on my own behalf, took a break from everything, Titus Studios Media was temporarily closed. 

After a few months, I decided to start Titus Studios Media Group back up, with a fresh new look, and a new direction. Titus Studios Media Group was officially a non-profit business in December 2016, and was renamed to Titus Studios Media. 

We are now focused on providing content and media creators services, such as, Video Editing, Audio Work, Camera Work, etc. We primarily do Video Editing and production for a few clients (some private).

We continue to keep our high standards, strive to produce the highest quality content, and continue to get much positivity out of our clients and work.
