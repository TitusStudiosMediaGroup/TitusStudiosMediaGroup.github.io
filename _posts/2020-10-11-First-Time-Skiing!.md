On the 11th of October I went on my first ski trip with a few of my mates. 

Juliet has been pretty keen to get me skiing for some time now, since the start of the season actually. Admittedly I was pretty keen too, it was probably one of the only sports I would be somewhat good at and that I would enjoy.

We were going to go skiing around mid season, but that plan fell through. After some long time we both ended up having openings in our time and that was the weekend! It was set no going back now, And very lucky we did because that weekend was the very end of season. The season was extended 2 weeks into Spring because of good looking weather.

My father has been a long time skier, he hasn't been in a few years however so I invited him to come along. Judging by this enthusiasm I would say he was quite pleased haha.

In order for us to get to Whakapapa ontime (we wanted to get there early in the morning to get ski rentals, around 9am), we had to leave at 6am, we ended up leaving around 6:45, but no problem, We had accounted an hour for traffic, roadworks or food stops. Since we left so early on a Saturday morning there was virtually no traffic on the Napier Taupo Road. We also only had one breakfast stop and didn't end up checking into our hotel and just drove straight up to the mountain instead, this would have a downside however.

We also saw a lot of early morning fog as we drove towards Taupo

The forecast for the mountain is looking great! They had a huge snow fall the night before, and the wind isn't looking too bad.

The road had so many great views of the mountain as we got closer, it got better!

Bruce Road (the road that goes to Whakapapa) was clear of snow, and it was a very smooth drive up.

At last we were at the top of the mountain, with our ski passes in hand, or on my phone to be real. Went to rentals and got our gear on, and there we met up with Juliet and Bryce. We headed down to Happy Valley which is the beginner learning area, with a gentle slope, but if you don't know what you are doing, you can lose control of your speed and go flying into some pretty sharp rocks! Ouch!

I will say I picked up skiing pretty quickly, but that's hardly the case. I definitely picked the basics up, but there were alot of falling over and crashing before I got to that stage haha, no hard feelings to the person I hit on my first run!

## LUNCH TIME!
She tells me this is normal, if you get my drift.

Oh yeah grumpy old fossil, heâ€™s just angry that his food isn't heated.

## T-Bar

Up to T-Bar which probably wasn't a good idea, knowing my experience on the skis so far, I pretty much lost control of my speed and then fell head first into the snow, and then had to butt slide all the way down the mountain because it was way to steep for me to get up and back on my skis, which disconnected. After about an hour I got back to the T-Bar Cafe, which has a nice view of the mountain, and down at the very bottom you can see Happy Valley.

Eww the mountain is peeing!

I had a few more short runs on Happy Valley and that was it for the day. A very nice view of the mountain as we drove to our Hotel in National Park

# The Next Day

A great start to the day, looking at the live camera on T-Bar, can see the lovely sunrise above the clouds.

Remember that I said we went straight to Whakapapa and not our Hotel and said that wasn't a good thing, here's why!
I got omega sunburnt, I was going to put on sunscreen at our hotel but we didn't stop there so I completely forgot, ouchhh!

Alot of cloud and fog as we went up Bruce Road, today wasn't as good as the day before, but it wouldn't be blearing with sun, and the snow was a bit softer too

This is the "Magic Carpet" in Happy Valley, this is how you get back up to the top

# That is all

Wow this was pretty long, but it was really fun and I'm 1000% going next season, was a bummer that I was getting really good and even doing some jumps at the end of the second day, and then it's just the end of season and everything closes up, but there is always next time!
