# Who am I?
### Hi, I'm Titus, Well that's what my online friends like to call me. I'm a avid programmer and I specialize in the language Expression 2 (E2)  and Lua. I spend most of my life playing Garry's Mod and Driving Locomotives, Usually with some mates of mine. I'm a proud Kiwi and eat way to many pies.

# What I do
### I do coding in Expression 2 (E2)  and Lua. I play computer games and spend hours not if weeks working on detailing Locomotives and making "Shit-Posting" E2s. And Pain is  NOT Getting the new donut E2 :)

# Current Projects
### * [RLC Pt 2.0 (Gamma)](https://github.com/MagnumMacKivler/RLCPT2) - Bug finding and adding missing details or oversights.
### * [Titus's Locomotive Extras E2 Pack](https://github.com/TitusStudiosMediaGroup/Titus_Locomotive_Extras_E2s) - My Public E2 Pack, Made because I hate to see people running un-detailed units with lerpy E2s.
### * Some other small projects in my own time - Don't ask about them.
