# Who am I?
### Hi, I'm Titus, Well that's what my online friends like to call me. I'm a avid programmer and I specialize in the language Expression 2 (E2)  and Lua. I spend most of my life playing Garry's Mod and Driving Locomotives, Usually with some mates of mine. I'm a proud Kiwi and eat way to many pies.
