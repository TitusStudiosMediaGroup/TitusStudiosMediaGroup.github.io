# What is **Titus Studios Media?**
**Titus Studios Media** *(Also known as Titus Studios Media Group)* is a Media Production Business that I run locally out of my home. We edit and produce content for YouTube and other such online services. Titus Studios was established on the **25th of July 2013**, since then we have made/edited numerous series, documentaries, short films, and have been editing for a number of YouTubers.

We continue to keep our high standards and produce high quality content for the public to view.

# Looking Ahead
Titus Studios is planning to buy a new Studio space between Late 2020 ~ 2021, the new Studio will have more room for:
* Large Keying Screen (Greenscreen)
* Space for larger camera equipment
* Better lighting
* Builtin XLR Mic & DMX Lighting for quick setup
* Photoshoot room
* Editing Den

This will allow us to expand what content we can produce and have bigger area for larger projects
