# What is this?

www.titusstudios.net is my personal and business website. Hosted on GitHub, built with Jekyll and all coded from scratch, with some FTP file auto-syncing scripts using the GitHub API. It also serves as my online file host, and hosts data for projects of mine and others.

# Who are you?

Hi, I’m Paxton. I commonly go by the alias “Titus” online, derived from my company name. I’m a geek. I have too many hobbies to count, eager to learn new things, and have a never ending connection with Technology and Programming.



# What do you do?

I do a lot of things. Notably: Programming (Expression2, Lua, C#, etc), is a large part of my life, I do heaps of it in my free time, same goes for, Tinkering with Electronics (Microprocessors, Raspberry Pi, Arduino), Engineering, and have lots of interest in technology, computing, and servers. I do all sorts. I’m very hands on and dont mind to get dirty in the process.
